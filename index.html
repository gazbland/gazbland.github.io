        <h4>Opportunity For Value</h4>

        <p>
            Data science is a pretty tough discipline. The entry requirements are a rare combination of programming, statistics and communication skills. Two out of three, you can find relatively easily, but the trifecta leads to the greatest value and return on investment.

        <p>
            My trajectory has lead me through three different disciplines, in three different countries, and private-sector managerial experience in a fourth. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Starting in Cambridge, United Kingdom, I studied the biological side of the Natural Sciences Tripos at Trinity Hall. This course and college is really a fantastic beginning to it all; there I learned how to independently manage my projects and learning when a thousand and one things are being thrown at you.
            <br>
            <br>
            Continuing to Trieste, Italy, I attained a PhD in Cognitive psychology at SISSA. This city and institute allowed me to grow as a researcher and person; there I learned how to really dig deep into a subject, a project and many concepts. Ultimately I was working on how the brain reuses evolutionarily older modules and functions to perform more modern cognitive tasks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then to Frankfurt-Am-Main, Germany, I worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in Systems Neuroscience as Max Planck of Brain Research. This was an absolute dream job, I studied the way neural networks processes and communicate what we see in the best possible model system; non-human primates. The problems system neuroscientists study are hard, so pursuing and solving something at that level is incredibly motivating. This is a place where I vastly expanded and refined my quantitative analytical toolbox. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Most recently to Bogot&aacute, Colombia, I built and managed the behavioural data-science team at Alkanza. This team is a central value proposition for the rapidly growing b2b fintech firm. Here I completed my profile as a data-science for the private sector. To leverage the potential value and expertise of my data-scientists I made sure that we were heavily integrated with all the other sectors. It was essential for us to have great relationships with key decision makers, engineers, product managers and designers. Through those discussions we could identify how our data could be best put to use, or if we needed to acquire data to answer crucial questions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, at Alkanza, I would regularly direct projects that brought together multiple departments both internally and those of our clients. Charged with understanding and finding value in our clients' users' behaviour, we worked on CRM, marketing, UI/UX, risk-tolerance and other behavioural financial measures. It is fascinating, that in a company with such a focused product, that the scope and utility of data-science can still be so broad.
            <br>
            <br>
            And with that, I am enjoying my present projects.
            <br>

    <!-- [SECTION] - Capabilities -->
    <div class="jump" id="capabilities"></div>
    <div class="section">
        <h4>Capabilities</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Web Development</b>
            <br>
            Firstly, <strong>HTML/JS/CSS</strong> were used to construct this website. It is a simple single page offering, and so it doesn't really require any frameworks such as <strong>django</strong>.  More frequently, I use <strong>flask</strong>. I'll probably get in to <strong>reactJS</strong> (as soon as I find time) because it seems quite popular and I like the idea of components (I'm pretty OOP in other languages). Another markup I use is <strong>Latex</strong> for writing papers, but it has pretty limited use outside of academia.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Communication Of Insights</b>
            <br>
            The <a href="#veps">graphic</a> in the opportunities section is a good example of how data can be beautiful. It gives a good idea of the variability of each of the classes of visually evoked potentials (sic. brain waves, <small>kinda</small>), whilst conveying the main message of there being distinct clusters in the data. Usually I'd be reluctant to have such a complicated graphic. Anything beyond univariate is a gamble to convey, so it is important to be careful in considering your chart-type when going to multivariate conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Analysis</b>
            <br>
            Analysis is the part of my career that has been the most persistent and rewarding. For many years, I was a <strong>MATLAB</strong> devotee. For numerical tasks it is hard to beat. If I have to go more granular then <strong>C++</strong> is a vindictive friend. I use <strong>C</strong> primarily to build <strong>CUDA</strong> kernels, and then usually wrap that in <strong>Python</strong>. Getting around in <strong>Linux</strong> is far easier if you know a bit of <strong>Bash</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Data Management</b>
            <br>
            I used to only work with binary files for data storage, but that isn't compatible with business use so I'm a huge convert to <strong>postgreSQL</strong> (less so <strong>mongoDB</strong>) and <strong>sqlAlchemy</strong> is a joy to get your postgres into your Python in a deployable way. I am by no means a query wizard, but I'm getting there, in the meantime I have enough languages to deal with the post-processing required when the query can't quite pivot the way I need.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Machine Learning</b>
            <br>
            I really like <strong>sklearn</strong>, it has a lot of useful tools, some of which are pretty dangerous <small><small>(all the decision trees)</small></small>. But, you've got your SVMs and a bunch of regressions in there, so it's a daily essential. I've more recently been using <strong>Keras</strong> for deep neural networks. I hope that leads me more and more into the granularity of <strong>Tensorflow</strong> upon which it is implemented. But, in the end, providing you're using Python, you can do a lot with <strong>Numpy</strong> with a little help from <strong>Scipy</strong> for your probability distributions.
